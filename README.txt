Dear FSD Team,

Please note in this todo task user can create todo with title in '/home' page.

we used local storage to store this todo.

and user can edit todo in /edit-todo/:id page.

and user can delete todo and see the deleted todos in /deleted-tasks, if user want to remove or delete the deleted todo
permanently we can hit button "Remove Permanently ", so delete remove completely.

user can change status as completed from not completed, because we set default to not completd evary new task.

If user want to see all tasks, hit All Tasks, so the path navigate to '/todo-list' and showing all tasks.

If user want see Completed tasks he/she can hit the tab 'Completed Tasks' and page navigate to '/completed-tasks'.

Thank you for reading this message and read the codes.
